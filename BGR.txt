the SRVA2232 address you will get it from icinga, but this does not matter as you need to change the service template for the disks
 
go to CRME
 
jump to 10.0.1.50
 
then from there jump to srva5115
 
then access icinga on https://srva5113/icingaweb2
 
you need to be part of the icinga2-admins group on active directory
 
use your username and password for active directory to login
 
make sure that you change the templates, not the services assigned to the hosts
